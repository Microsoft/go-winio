// Package guid provides a GUID type. The backing structure for a GUID is
// identical to that used by the golang.org/x/sys/windows GUID type.
// There are two main binary encodings used for a GUID, the big-endian encoding,
// and the Windows (mixed-endian) encoding. See here for details:
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Encoding
